Well well well. Look what we have here. Another non-cowboy-hat-wearing, brown-boot-shining sissy soo. You think you can waltz right in to my saloon, grab a holo-deck, beat the world's greatest holo-cards player, and suddenly you're the world's greatest holo-cards player? You must be new to this town, country-kicker. This is Futuremus City. We don't polly to that kind of disrespect 'round these Xenohomes.
